In this assignment, we were tasked with designing a memory manager for a simulated disk. Functionality includes: 

1) Allocatign memory when a new file is created or an existing file needs more space
2) reading and writing from existing files
3) traversing the directory.

Note that there are many supporting files provided by the instructor needed to run this program which aren't included here.
